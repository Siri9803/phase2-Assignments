    <p>A paragraph is a collection of words strung together to make a longer unit than a sentence. Several sentences
        often make a paragraph. There are normally three to eight sentences in a paragraph. Paragraphs can start with a
        five-space indentation or by skipping a line and then starting over. This makes it simpler to tell when one
        paragraph ends and the next starts simply it has 3-9 lines.

        A topic phrase appears in most ordered types of writing, such as essays. This paragraph's topic sentence informs
        the reader about the topic of the paragraph. In most essays, numerous paragraphs make statements to support a
        thesis statement, which is the essay's fundamental point.

        Paragraphs may signal when the writer changes topics. Each paragraph may have a number of sentences, depending
        on the topic.

    <p>A paragraph is a series of sentences that are organized and coherent, and are all related to a single topic.
        Almost every piece of writing you do that is longer than a few sentences should be organized into paragraphs.
        This is because paragraphs show a reader where the subdivisions of an essay begin and end, and thus help the
        reader see the organization of the essay and grasp its main points.

        Paragraphs can contain many different kinds of information. A paragraph could contain a series of brief examples
        or a single long illustration of a general point. It might describe a place, character, or process; narrate a
        series of events; compare or contrast two or more things; classify items into categories; or describe causes and
        effects. Regardless of the kind of information they contain, all paragraphs share certain characteristics. One
        of the most important of these is a topic sentence.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>List item 1</li>
        <li>List item 2</li>
        <li>List item 3</li>
    </ul>
