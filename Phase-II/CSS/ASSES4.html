    <p class="paragraph">PARAGRAPH STRUCTURE <br>
        Most paragraphs in an essay have a three-part structure—introduction, body, and conclusion. You can see this
        structure in paragraphs whether they are narrating, describing, comparing, contrasting, or analyzing
        information. Each part of the paragraph plays an important role in communicating your meaning to your reader.

        Introduction: the first section of a paragraph; should include the topic sentence and any other sentences at the
        beginning of the paragraph that give background information or provide a transition.

        Body: follows the introduction; discusses the controlling idea, using facts, arguments, analysis, examples, and
        other information.

        Conclusion: the final section; summarizes the connections between the information discussed in the body of the
        paragraph and the paragraph’s controlling idea.

        The following paragraph illustrates this pattern of organization. In this paragraph the topic sentence and
        concluding sentence (CAPITALIZED) both help the reader keep the paragraph’s main point in mind.

        SCIENTISTS HAVE LEARNED TO SUPPLEMENT THE SENSE OF SIGHT IN NUMEROUS WAYS. In front of the tiny pupil of the eye
        they put, on Mount Palomar, a great monocle 200 inches in diameter, and with it see 2000 times farther into the
        depths of space. Or they look through a small pair of lenses arranged as a microscope into a drop of water or
        blood, and magnify by as much as 2000 diameters the living creatures there, many of which are among man’s most
        dangerous enemies. Or, if we want to see distant happenings on earth, they use some of the previously wasted
        electromagnetic waves to carry television images which they re-create as light by whipping tiny crystals on a
        screen with electrons in a vacuum. Or they can bring happenings of long ago and far away as colored motion
        pictures, by arranging silver atoms and color-absorbing molecules to force light waves into the patterns of
        original reality. Or if we want to see into the center of a steel casting or the chest of an injured child, they
        send the information on a beam of penetrating short-wave X rays, and then convert it back into images we can see
        on a screen or photograph. THUS ALMOST EVERY TYPE OF ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION YET DISCOVERED HAS BEEN USED TO
        EXTEND OUR SENSE OF SIGHT IN SOME WAY. <br>
