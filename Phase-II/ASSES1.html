            Main article: Early Age
            In the 6th–5th century BCE, the Maldives already had their kingdoms.[21] The country has an established
            history of over 2,500 years according to historical evidence and legends.[34] Early settlers in the
            Maldives
            were probably Gujaratis who reached and settled Sri Lanka about 500 BCE. Evidence of cultural influence
            from
            North India can be deduced from the methods of boatbuilding and silver punch-marked <br>
            <br>

            The Mahāvaṃsa (300 BCE) has records of people from Sri Lanka emigrating to the Maldives.[20] Assuming
            that
            cowrie shells come from the Maldives, historians believe that there may have been people living in the
            Maldives during the Indus Valley civilisation (3300–1300 BCE).[36] A number of artefacts show the
            presence
            of Hinduism in the country before the Islamic period.[21] <br>
            <br>
            According to the book Kitāb fi āthār Mīdhu al-qādimah (كتاب في آثار ميذو القديمة) (On the Ancient Ruins
            of
            Meedhoo), written in the 17th century in Arabic by Allama Ahmed Shihabuddine (Allama Shihab al-Din) of
            Meedhoo in Addu Atoll, the first settlers of the Maldives were people known as Dheyvis.[20] They came
            from
            the Kalibanga in India.[20] The time of their arrival is unknown but it was before Emperor Asoka's
            kingdom
            in 269–232 BCE. Shihabuddin's story tallies remarkably well with the recorded history of South Asia and
            that
            of the copperplate document of the Maldives known as Loamaafaanu.[20] <br>
            <br>
            The Maapanansa,[21] the copper plates on which recorded the history of the first Kings of the Maldives
            from
            the Solar Dynasty, were lost quite early on.

            A 4th-century notice written by Ammianus Marcellinus (362 CE) speaks of gifts sent to the Roman emperor
            Julian by a deputation from the nation of Divi. The name Divi is very similar to Dheyvi who were the
            first
            settlers of Maldives.[21] <br>
            <br>
            The ancient history of the Maldives is told in copperplates, ancient scripts carved on coral artefacts,
            traditions, language and different ethnicities of Maldivians.[20]

            The first Maldivians did not leave any archaeological artefacts. Their buildings were probably built of
            wood, palm fronds, and other perishable materials, which would have quickly decayed in the salt and wind
            of
            the tropical climate. Moreover, chiefs or headmen did not reside in elaborate stone palaces, nor did
            their
            religion require the construction of large temples or compounds.[37] <br>
            <br>
            Comparative studies of Maldivian oral, linguistic, and cultural traditions confirm that the first
            settlers
            were people from the southern shores of the neighbouring Indian subcontinent,[38] including the
            Giraavaru
            people, mentioned in ancient legends and local folklore about the establishment of the capital and
            kingly
            rule in Malé.[39]

            A strong underlying layer of Dravidian and North Indian cultures survives in Maldivian society, with a
            clear
            Elu substratum in the language, which also appears in place names, kinship terms, poetry, dance, and
            religious beliefs.[40] The North Indian system was brought by the original Sinhalese from Sri Lanka.
            Malabar
            and Pandya seafaring culture led to the settlement of the Islands by Tamil and Malabar seafarers.[40]

            The Maldive Islands were mentioned in ancient Sangam Tamil literature as "Munneer Pazhantheevam" or
            "Older
            Islands of Three Seas".
