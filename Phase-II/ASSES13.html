    <h1>Line Breaks Example</h1>
    <p>In the 6thâ€“5th century BCE, the Maldives already had their kingdoms. <br>The country has an established
        history of over 2,500 years according to historical evidence and legends. <br> Early settlers in the
        Maldives were probably Gujaratis who reached and settled Sri Lanka about 500 BCE. <br> Evidence of cultural influence
        from North India can be deduced from the methods of boatbuilding and silver punch-marked. <br> <br>
        The most famous legend about the lost city of Dwarka can be found in the ancient epic of Mahabharata. <br> Dwarka,
        like Atlantis, is said to have sunk beneath the sea at some point in the distant past. <br> However, unlike Atlantis,
        whose remains have never been discovered, remnants of this ancient kingdom could be found in the depths.
